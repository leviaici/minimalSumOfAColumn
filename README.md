# minimalSumOfAColumn
Using Greedy method, i had a small Uni homework.
In the given file, "exemplu.txt" you are being given a number ("n" as it is shown in my code) of lines and columns of a square matrix and a second number ("k" in my code) which means the selected column. I wanted it to create some random values for this so i used rand and printed in the file 2 random numbers. You don't need the "exemplu.txt" file as it will be created automatically by the "w" mode of file opening.
The matrix must contain all the numbers from 1 to n^2 (e.g. n = 3, the matrix must have the elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
On every line, all the numbers must be arranged in ascending order.
The sum of the "k" column must be minimum.
The code prints the freshly created matrix with those rules.
